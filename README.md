# Paint

Project inspiration from MS Paint app; built using JS, HTML and CSS.

Core JS principles applied for DOM manipulation. Made use of the HTML canvas element, heavy use of event listeners for change, click, mousedown, etc. used to properly track & record movements as you draw.

MDN documentation for the canvas, 2d rendering, saving to local storage and ability to download your paint in jpg format.
